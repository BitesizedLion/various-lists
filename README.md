This repository contains uBlacklist lists that I personally maintain and use.

Currently, the repository contains the following lists:

* ublacklist-fakepng.txt - a list for hiding fake transparent image sites from google images
* ublacklist.txt - a general list that currently has the following categories:
* * StackOverflow/Github Mirrors
* * Misc Spam
* * Fake Torrent/Piracy
* * Fake Hosting Locations
* * PR Companies
* * Google Maps / Yelp Mirrors
* * "How To" Spam
* * Insights/Stats/Package Info Spam
* * Solution/Fixes Spam
* * Blog Spam
* * Scareware Sites
* * Hosting/VPN Referral Spam
* * Fake/Fraudulent Stores
* ublacklist-personal.txt - a list for content I dislike, but shouldn't belong in any of other lists.
* ublacklist-pinboards.txt - a list for pinboard sites, such as pinterest, flipboard (possibly other mentions of them aswell, such as google play)
